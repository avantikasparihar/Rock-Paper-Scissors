# Rock-Paper-Scissors

User vs Computer rock paper scissors game build using simple html, css and javascript.

Another mini project that I took upon to get more experience in web development with the most basic tech-stack, i.e. HTML and Javascript with CSS6 for styling. 
Took just a day(afternoon, to be more precise!) to complete this one. Although rock paper scissors is a game with a pretty simple logic, the focus was to manage 
all the CSS elements and their interaction with the javascript.

All in all, this was fun!
